# Learning From Data (Solutions)

This repository contains a set of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks
showcasing my solutions to the programming problems of the "Learning From Data"
course offered by
[Prof. Dr. Yaser Abu-Mostafa (Caltech)](https://work.caltech.edu/index.html) on
the [edX platform](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CaltechX+CS1156x+3T2017).
It contains almost only programming problems, as the theoretical problems are
imho best done (and digested) in a very old-school way: using pen and paper.


## Dependencies

Implementations of algorithms are in Python (>= 3.6) and depend on the following
libraries

 * [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) (>=1.13)
 * [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)  (>=2.0.2)
 * [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org/) (>= 0.19)
 * [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) (>= 0.19)
 * [`numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/) (>= 0.35)

Note that for accessing the online data sets, you will also need
[`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). For Windows users, these
dependencies are most easily satisfied by using [conda](https://conda.io/docs/)
